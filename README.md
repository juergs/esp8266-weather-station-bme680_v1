# esp8266-weather-station-bme680_v1

Basically based on the extraordinary work of [Thingpulse](https://github.com/ThingPulse/esp8266-weather-station) and their 
[Graph-Library](https://github.com/ThingPulse/minigrafx). Also many thanks to
[Joerg](https://github.com/herrmannj/AirQuality), who did elementary and great work on BME680 getting TVOC out of resistance reading without the need of BSEC-Implementation!

2.4 inch TFT-Display with socket for WEMOS D1 mini. See Board@ [Wemos TFT](https://www.exp-tech.de/displays/lcd/9184/wemos-tft-2.4-touch-shield).
I was using this [BME680-Breakout-Board](https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/LXuNziGd) and [kriswiner](https://github.com/kriswiner/BME680). Making also use of Adafruit BME680-Library.
